print(float(2))
# 6. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
# Please write your response in complete sentences.
"Parameter is a placeholder for data that will be actually used an Argument goes into the function invocation or call"
# 7. What is the difference between a function definition

"function definition is look a play that a team learn  function invocation is when your actually using it"
# 8. Why are functions useful in programming? Provide at least two reasons

# 9. Write a code block that uses the appropriate operator for each scenario
x = 15
y = 20.
# x is greater than y
# x and 15 are both the same
# x and y are not the same`

# 10. Create a function that will take in two values. Your function should
# take in 1 value as a parameter, and the other value should be passed in by the
