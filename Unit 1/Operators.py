# Operator
# Operators are a construct (built-in system) tha give
# data type more actions and power

#Arithmetic Operator family
#Arithmetic Operators are simply math operations.

print(2 + 4) # additon operator
print(10 - 10) # subtraction operator
print(2 / 1) #division operator
print( 20.9 * 12.34) #multiplication operator

#Print ()

#Assignment Operator family 
# these operators assign value to
#variables (otherwise known as container)
# Key / value pairs

schoolName = "Boys Latin"
age = 17
UserName ="azure"
password =12354
location = '123.12334.2342'


age += 2 #adding a new value to our variable.
age *= 3 #multiplying a new value to our variable.
print(age)


#Comparison Operator family
#comparison family of operators simply compares values

print(2 > 1)
print(100 < 29)
print("123ABC" == "123Avbc") #double equal signs mean its comaring if the value s are " The SAME"

print(2 != 3)# Not the same

#Logical Operartor Family 
# it checks and compares if certain code condition
# are true or false

print(3 > 1 and "Micah" == "Micah")
# the AND operator ckecks to see BOTH condition are true.
#IF BOTH are TRUE the answer is TRUE.

print(2 == 1 or 3 > 2)
# The OR operator  checks if ONE of the condition is TRUE.
# So long as ONE of the conditions is TRUE, it will be TRUE.

print(not(3 > 1 and "Micah" == "Micah")) #false
# The Not operator will give the opposite result.
# the NOT operator flips the result.
